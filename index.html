              About Lauren
            </h2>

            <p>
              Lauren specializes in inspired web development and design  
              for small businesses. Lauren’s years as a web designer gave her an eye 
              for beauty. Her techinical background started in physics and bloomed 
              her career as a full-stack web developer and designer.
              Lauren is a one stop shop for both design 
              and development. With the eye of a designer and 
              the ability of a developer, your vision will come to life!

        <p>
          Lauren’s past clients include cannabis brands, yoga teachers, travel companies, 
          skincare lines, musicians, artists, and more. 
          Whatever your business, we think of designing a website as a 
          collaborative process of co-creation. Lauren strives to keep your 
          work with her light-hearted, joyful, and efficient. The design 
          process should be organized and structured enough to keep 
          it stress free, yet loose enough to allow creativity to work 
          its magic!
